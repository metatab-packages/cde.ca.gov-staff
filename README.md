## License

The source data, from the California Department of Education, does not
explicitly reference a license, but since the top-level website for California
indicates that data published on the State of California website [is
generally in the public domain](https://www.ca.gov/use/),  we assume it is in
the public domain. Derived data included in this package is also in the public domain. Metadata in this package ( contained in the ``metadata.csv`` file ) is
derived from metadata for the source package, and is also in the public domain.
